* Creating a multisig account in Eclipse

You're REQUIRED to create the following keys:

- =keypair= (used to create the multisig account itself)
- =members= (the keys that are going to sign the multisig transaction)

The =keypair= key needs to have funds.

The following keys are OPTIONAL:
- =config-authority= (if you want to update the config of the multisig
  later on, this key is required)
- =rent-collector=
- =multisig-keypair= (a private key used to make the address of the
  multisig account deterministic)

After you have created all the required keys (maybe with a wallet,
maybe with =solana-keygen=), you can execute

#+begin_src sh
  cargo build --release
  ./target/release/solana-multisig-client --help
  ./taget/release/solana-multisig-client multisig-create --help
#+end_src

And follow the instructions to pass the correct private key paths or
pubkeys to the account creation script.

You also need to pass the correct program id and rpc url to the
program, as instructed per =--help=. In Eclipse, the program id is
=eSQDSMLf3qxwHVHeTr9amVAGmZbRLY2rFdSURandt6f=, and the rpc url is
