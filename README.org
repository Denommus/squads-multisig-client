* Creating a multisig account in Eclipse

You're REQUIRED to create the following keys:

- =keypair= (used to create the multisig account itself)
- =members= (the keys that are going to sign the multisig transaction)

The following keys are OPTIONAL:
- =config-authority= (if you want to update the config of the multisig
  later on, this key is required)
- =rent-collector=
- =multisig-keypair= (a private key used to make the address of the
  multisig account deterministic)

After you have created all the required keys (maybe with a wallet,
maybe with =solana-keygen=), you can execute

#+begin_src sh
  cargo build --release
  ./taget/release/solana-multisig-client multisig-create --help
#+end_src

And follow the instructions to pass the correct private key paths or
pubkeys to the account creation script.
